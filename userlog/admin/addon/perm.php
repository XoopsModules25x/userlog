// Here you can set ADDITIONAL permission in file for webmasters in your website, ONLY if you want to limit the access to userlog module for some of them.

// Webmasters that dont have access cannot:
// 1- go to the userlog > admin
// 2- go to the userlog > preferences
// 3- install, uninstall or update userlog
// 4- dump any table in system -> maintenance -> dump

// empty array means nothing.
// Note: you can delete this file if you dont need it.

// if you add uid of webmasters or those users who have admin permissions in userlog module, other admins will not have permission anymore.
// e.g.: $perm["super"]["user"] = array(1,234,23451); // it means only users with uid=1,234,23451 have access and other webmasters dont have access.

// if you add groups with admin permission in  whole site (webmasters) or admin permission in userlog module, other admin groups dont have access.
// e.g.: $perm["super"]["group"] = array(1,7,9); // it means only groups 1,7,9 have access and other groups dont have access.
